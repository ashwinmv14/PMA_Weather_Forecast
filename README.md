### ðŸ“œ **Project Explanation (Weather Forecast)**

1. **Loaded the Dataset**:  
   Imported a weather dataset containing features like temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind speed, and air quality readings along with timestamps.

2. **Data Cleaning - Missing Values**:  
   Checked for missing values and handled them by forward-filling or dropping rows where necessary to ensure no null values exist during modeling.

3. **Data Cleaning - Outlier Handling**:  
   Identified outliers in numerical columns using boxplots and clipped extreme values using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to prevent distortion in model training.

4. **Feature Normalization**:  
   Normalized all numeric columns using MinMaxScaler to bring them to a common 0â€“1 range, which improves model stability and convergence speed.

5. **Categorical and Irrelevant Feature Removal**:  
   Dropped unnecessary categorical columns such as country, location name, timezone, and moon phase, as they do not contribute to time series forecasting.

6. **Datetime Indexing**:  
   Converted the `last_updated` feature to datetime format and set it as the index for the DataFrame, preparing the dataset for time series analysis.

7. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   Plotted time series graphs for temperature and precipitation, generated correlation heatmaps, and visualized feature distributions to understand data trends and patterns.

8. **Data Resampling**:  
   Resampled the temperature data into daily averages to smoothen high-frequency noise and simplify the forecasting task.

9. **Train-Test Split**:  
   Split the time series into an 80% training set and 20% testing set, maintaining the temporal order to preserve time series properties.

10. **Model 1: Exponential Smoothing (ES)**:  
    Built a basic forecasting model using Exponential Smoothing, which captures the overall temperature trend assuming gradual changes over time.

11. **Model 2: ARIMA Model**:  
    Built an ARIMA(5,1,0) model to forecast temperature based on both autoregressive and moving average components after differencing the time series once.

12. **Forecasting and Evaluation**:  
    Forecasted future temperatures using both ES and ARIMA models, and evaluated their performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metrics.

13. **Performance Comparison**:  
    Observed that Exponential Smoothing performed better than ARIMA with lower MAE and RMSE values, while ARIMA's basic version remained too flat and less reactive.

14. **Ensemble Model Creation**:  
    Created a simple ensemble model by averaging the predictions from Exponential Smoothing and ARIMA, resulting in a more balanced and stable forecast.

15. **Visualization and Final Interpretation**:  
    Plotted the actual, predicted, and ensembled forecasts together, demonstrating that while Exponential Smoothing individually performed the best, the ensemble produced a reliable and robust forecast that combined the strengths of both models.
